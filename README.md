# CO2Pred
Se realizó un script en python que cumplé con las caracteristicas solicitadas.

Question 1: Data Acquisition and Initial Exploration (30 minutes)
Task:
Download CO2 emissions data and a small set of socio-economic indicators (e.g., GDP,
population) from the World Bank’s Climate Change database.
Instructions:
1. Access the World Bank database using Python, R, or MATLAB.
2. Download CO2 emissions data and 2-3 relevant socio-economic indicators for a few
countries.
3. Clean and preprocess the data, handling any missing values.
4. Provide a brief summary of the data, including key statistics and any correlations you
observe.
Deliverable:
- A script that downloads and preprocesses the data.
- A Markdown file summarizing key statistics and correlations.

Question 2: Basic Predictive Modeling (40 minutes)
Task:
Develop a basic predictive model to forecast CO2 emissions based on the selected socio-
economic indicators.
Instructions:
1. Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Train a simple regression model using the socio-economic indicators as predictors.
3. Evaluate the model&#39;s performance with basic metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²).
4. Provide a brief interpretation of the model’s performance.
Deliverable:
- A script that trains the predictive model and evaluates its performance.
- A Markdown file explaining the model results and performance.

Question 3: Scenario Analysis (30 minutes)
Task:
Using the model, estimate the change in CO2 emissions if a country&#39;s GDP increases by 5%.
Instructions:
1. Use the predictive model to simulate the impact of a 5% increase in GDP on CO2
emissions for one or two countries.
2. Analyze and interpret the results.
Deliverable:
- A script that simulates the scenario.
- A Markdown file summarizing the results and providing a brief interpretation.
